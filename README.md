This is a draft design mockup for a Freemium SaaS platform built on top of [ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox). It intends to make internet archiving more accessible to the average non-technical user, and fits into the same niche as services like Pocket Premium, Pinboard, and Evernote Clips.
